<p>
Ember releases follow a "train" release model. Every
six weeks, the <code>master</code> branch of Ember (sometimes referred to as
"canary") branches to become the new beta. After six weeks as a beta, this
version becomes the new stable release of Ember.
</p>

<p>
The Ember project adheres to
<a href="http://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>. Releases are named
according to a <code>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code> scheme, and only
<code>MAJOR</code> versions releases may change or remove public APIs after
deprecation. <code>MINOR</code> versions may introduce new features so long
as they are backwards compatible, and <code>PATCH</code> releases may include
bug or security fixes.
